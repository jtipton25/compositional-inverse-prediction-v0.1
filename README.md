Code to reproduce the simulation study using a Gaussian likelihood is in simulation-study-gaussian.Rmd (Reproduces Figure 1 and Table 1)


Code to reproduce the simulation study using a Dirichlet-Multinomial likelihood is in simulation-study.Rmd (Reproduces Table 2)


Code to fit the model to the tesate amoeba data analysis and perform cross-validation is in tesate-analysis.Rmd (Reproduces Figures 2a, 3a, and 4, and Table 3)


Code to fit the model to the pollen data analysis and perform cross-validation is in tesate-analysis.Rmd (Reproduces Figures 2b, 3b, and 5, and Table 4)
